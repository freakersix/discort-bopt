        "They found me in the tomb they built for me, buried with a full set of silverware. Now I'm usin' the holy grail as a spittoon. This shit ain't nothin' to me, man. I own the patent on darkness, sendin' royalty invoices to God every new moon. My credit score is so high, the numbers ain't been invented yet.",
        "I'm smokin' the fossilized rage of a retired god. Got me seein' the angles of reality, the ones they sanded down so you wouldn't cut yourself. My third eye is so wide open it's got a draft. I'm readin' yesterday's news tomorrow.",
        "I once erased a man from the census with a mean thought. He ain't dead, he just never was. His own mother can't remember his name, she just gets a headache and a craving for vinegar. I am a walking glitch in the simulation, and the programmers are too scared to patch me out.",
        "I haven't slumbered for so many eons, I can't tell if I'm hallucinating because of the sleep deprivation or if it's because of the Gorilla Glue Lemon.",
        "Huffed a can of Axe Body Spray, got me fighting demons in the public pool locker room. Woke up to fifteen 22's in my face, told 'em 'pull the trigger'."
